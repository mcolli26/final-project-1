All students will select a data set and perform an original data analysis culminating in a series of maps displayed on a research poster. Each student will be responsible for selecting a specific topic, cleaning their data, creating maps of their topic, and presenting the results. This process and project mirrors the steps taken to author a conference presentation (for all students) and a digital companion that would appear alongside a more formal journal article (for SOC 5650 students).. How are these instructions organized? These instructions are organized into vignettes (pronounced vin'yets). These are meant to create “bite sized” modules that break down the final project into discrete phases. Each vignette has a set of indicators on the top-level page for the vignette that provide you with some general information about what the vignette entails. These indicators will help you quickly navigate the instructions. What do I have to do? Each vignette includes an indicator that describes what the goal of the vignette is: Goal: create a quick summary of your project for Chris. The instructions will vary at different points based on whether you are enrolled in SOC 4615 or SOC 5650. Look for this indicator for information about who the vignette is designed for: Personnel: This vignette should be completed by all students. If the instructions are only for one of the sections, they will look like this: Personnel: This vignette should be completed by students in SOC 5650 only. What order do I have to do the vignettes in? Some of the vignettes can be worked on in parallel while others require that a prior vignette has been completed. If there is a pre-requisite vignette that must be completed first, this indicator will include pertinent details about ordering: Pre-requisties: This vignette should be completed after Vignette 6. Otherwise you will see this indicator: Pre-requisties: There are no pre-requisites for this vignette. What do I need to know how to do? Some of the vignettes require technical skills that will be covered as the semester progresses. If that is the case, those lectures will be identified with this indicator: Skills: Lectures 1 and 2 When are vignettes due? Some of the vignettes have hard due dates while others do not. For vignettes without a firm deadline, a suggested deadline will be provided for those of you who appreciate a bit more structure. Firm deadlines will be provided in an indicator at the top of each vignette that looks like this: Required Due Date: This vignette must be completed by March 15th. Suggested deadlines will look like this: Suggested Completion Date: This vignette should be completed by March 15th. What do I have to submit? All of the vignettes require you to produce something. A quick description of the deliverables associated with the vignette will be included in this indicator: Deliverables: A knit .Rmd notebook with the appropriate .md output that uses a literate programming approach to document your data cleaning efforts should be included in your final project repository. Data Analysis is not Linear The organization of these instructions implies a linear path - complete one vignette and then go on to the next. You’ll notice that the pre-requisite vignette box for most vignettes look something like this: Pre-requisties: This vignette should be started after Vignette 5’s initial completion. This wording is meant to remind you that data analysis is never a linear process. You are going to have to iterate over vignettes, often several times. You’ll perhaps do some initial data cleaning, calculate descriptive statistics, and notice that the frequency of a particular category is too small. So you’ll have to go back, re-code that particular variable, and recalculate your descriptive statistics. This process of iteration is the norm for statistical analysis. Even the most experienced statisticians do this - it is not a function of inexperience so much as it is the nature of doing analytic work. One of the reasons that a plain-text approach to programming and statistics is so powerful is that this iteration becomes easy. You won’t have to remember the series of menu selections and check boxes you chose to produce a particular output as you would with a GUI-driven statistical application. Rather, recalculating descriptive statistics is as easy as making a small change to the source code for the data cleaning notebook, knitting that notebook, and then re-knitting the descriptive statistics notebook. Working in this way gives you the freedom to explore and experiment as much as you’d like! "],

["crafting-a-research-question.html", "1.1 Crafting a Research Question", " 1.1 Crafting a Research Question The process of conducting a research project starts with defining a research question to explore. For many students, this can be daunting. Yale University Sociology’s Handbook for Undergraduate Thesis research usefully breaks down the types of questions sociologists answer into three broad categories. I’ve provided these three categories below along with some sample research questions on undocumented immigration: “Questions about the meaning of certain activities, practices, or experiences for particular social groups.” “How do classmates respond when a student discloses that they are an undocumented immigrant?” “How does participation in an immigrant advocacy group effect undocumented immigrants?” “How does disclosing undocumented status change the treatment of immigrants in social services settings?” “Questions about the ways that identification with larger social categories – race, ethnicity, religion, political identification, gender – affect aspects of social life.” “What is the relationship between political conservatism and beliefs about immigration?” “How do views of immigration vary based on gender identity?” “What is the relationship between religiosity and support for undocumented immigrants?” “Questions about the influence of particular variables on other variables or outcomes, including questions that compare groups and track trends across a broader scale.” “What is the relationship between levels of education and employment for undocumented immigrants?” “How does racial segregation impact the outcomes of undocumented immigrants in cities?” “What is the effect of DREAMer status on educational attainment?” Each student should think about the overarching category they want to conduct research in. Like the research process as a whole (see “Data Analysis is not Linear”), you may find that crafting a research question is an iterative process. You’ll start with a broad topic, make a first attempt at narrowing it down, and then subsequently update the question as you find some related sources (and, if you are in SOC 5650, conduct a full-fledged literature review). Research questions for this course will be necessarily descriptive - “what is the spatial distribution of x?” "],

["another-data-set.html", "1.4 Another Data Set", " 1.4 Another Data Set If the crime and non-emergency call data do not interest you, you are welcome to choose a topic of your own provided you can find appropriate data. 1.4.1 Characteristics of an Appropriate Data Set Data sets for your final project will have a number of salient characteristics: They should be spatial data. They should numerous - there should be at least several hundred observations that vary over space and, ideally, over time as well. Several thousand observations will be ideal. They must be countable - the number of 9-1-1 calls, resturants, or terrorist attacks, for example. They should be point data (or have the ability to be mapped as point data). Examples would be cities throughout a country or a region, resturant locations across a city, state, or province, and crime scene locations. They should be able to be aggregated up to some sort of higher order construct. Think about how resturant locations could be aggregated up to neighborhoods, municipalities, or counties. 1.4.2 Other Considerations There are a few other considerations to take into account. If you are a graduate student and have already identified a possible thesis topic, you may want pick a data set that is either a possible candidate for inclusion in your thesis or, at the very least, is conceptually related. You want to maximize the impact that your coursework has, so even if you are not sure whether or not the data set itself will be helpful, picking something in the same topic area will mean that your literature search can be put to use on future assignments (such as in your Research Methods course). 1.4.3 Finding an Appropriate Data Set In general, you are free to use any resource to identify a suitable data set that meets the above criteria with a couple of caveats: There is not time for you to collect your own data. There is not time for you to go through the IRB process to gain access to confidential data (either data that is not publicly available or data collected by a thesis adviser or other faculty member). The data you use should be licensed for re-use (it cannot be proprietary or otherwise restrictively licensed). The data should be well documented - you want to be very sure what each variable represents. If there is no code book or documentation, the data set is probably not appropriate for this project. See Chris if you have questions about this. "],

["data-storage.html", "2.1 Data Storage", " 2.1 Data Storage You will have a separate GitHub repository that is dedicated to the final project. This will facilitate some of the peer evaluation tasks you will be asked to complete over the course of the semester, allowing you to share a repository with a colleague without exposing all of your other work and grades in the process. All final project materials should be stored in this repository, and it should be organized following the project organization principles we’ve used this semester. This means that it should have subfolders for data/, docs/, results/, and source/ as well as a .Rproj file and an ArcGIS project file. Make sure you move your default geodatabase into the data/ folder as well. If subfolders are empty, they will not be tracked by GitHub. If you are using only one computer, the folder will remain visible locally and Git will start tracking it once you begin adding materials. If you are using multiple computers, you can create empty text files named .gitkeep using RStudio (File &gt; New File &gt; Text File) and keep one in each subfolder. Since you will be storing this repository on GitHub, you will be default be using version control for this project. You should make commits (like voting in Chicago!) early and often. Make sure that your commit messages are informative and clear. Remember, if you have to go back to an earlier version of your work, you will want to make it as easy as possible to do so. Also make sure that you are pushing to GitHub often and not just saving the work locally on your computer. This is part of your insurance against a catastrophic loss of your computer or a lab computer where you are working. You are strongly encouraged to use a more comprehesive backup solution, which you can lean more about in Sociospatial Data Science. "],

You can create it in RStudio (File &gt; New File &gt; Text File). This file should describe the goal of the repository and, at a high level, how various elements of the project repository fit together. This file should be saved as a markdown file (.md) and should use markdown formatting appropriately. 2.3.2 RESEARCH_LOG.md You will need to maintain a research log throughout the final project process. Before proceeding with the vignettes, create a well-formatted and organized research log in RStudio (File &gt; New File &gt; Text File) that is organized chronologically. The research log should use markdown syntax and be saved as a markdown file (.md). Keep this file updated and have it saved in the top-level of your assignment repository. For each day you work on the final project, there should be an entry that describes the work that you have done, what files you have created or modified, and how those modifications took place. Give as much detail as possible without directly replicating the notes you make in individual files using the literate programming approach. This will be particularly important for your mapmaking work in ArcGIS Pro, which is inherently not reproducible and thus good notes are imperative. Think of the research log as step-by-step instructions to yourself that would allow you to recreate all of your work should every final project file you work on be accidentally deleted or lost. For code, you can provide higher level details since, ideally, your literate programming approach means that your code is well annotated and described. For plots and your slides, you want to provide as much fine grained detail as possible down to specific font, color, and size choices for data and layout elements. "],

["what-is-an-annotated-bibliography.html", "3.1 What is an Annotated Bibliography?", " 3.1 What is an Annotated Bibliography? An Annotated Bibliography is one approach for documenting your research on a topic. It should be constructed using a thorough, systematic literature search of the peer reviewed literature on your topic. We are interested primarily in the peer reviewed literature because we we want to understand the scholarly debate that has unfolded about our topic. The peer review process is also one indicator of quality. We typically think of peer review as falling into two categories - books and journal articles. While the process for reviewing books is different from articles, academic books are typically sent out for review before they are published by the publisher. Peer reviewed books are typically published by either a university press (e.g. Oxford University Press or The University of California Press) or by a publishing house that specializes in academic content (e.g. John Wiley &amp; Sons). Journal articles that are peer reviewed will be published in an academic journal. There are many journals that publish sociological content, along with others that publish more broadly in the social sciences (Social Science &amp; Medicine is a great example). Be aware that not all journals are created equal - there is a whole group of so-called “predatory” journals (along with fake conferences) that capitalize on the “publish or perish” culture of academia as well as the relative isolation of many scholars in developing countries. While there are some lists of “predatory” journals, learning how to evaluate all articles critically is perhaps the best way to protect yourself against citing poor research. "],
["conducting-the-literature-search.html", "3.2 Conducting the Literature Search", " 3.2 Conducting the Literature Search 3.2.1 Analysis Development With your research question in-hand (see “Crafting a Research Question”), you will want to follow a semi-structured process for identifying appropriate peer reviewed sources. Document the places you search and the search terms / key words you use in your research log. As you find sources, I recommend keeping track of them in a spreadsheet. This makes it easier to figure out if you have already found and downloaded an article that you may come across multiple times. Dr. Raul Pacheco-Vega website has a great example of a spreadsheet used for tracking literature. In one sheet of a spreadsheet workbook, keep track of the sources you’ve found, scanned (see “Evaluating Sources”), and found not to be useful. This is to serve as a reference later if you come across an article again and cannot remember if you already looked at it or not. You can easily generate bibliographic citations in Google Scholar by searching for the source and clicking the double quote icon under its Google Scholar entry (highlighted in red): Clicking that icon should open a pop-up window that includes pre-formatted references in a number of different styles: I tend to use Chicago, which requires minimal editing for both books and articles to convert the citation to ASA (see “Writing an Annotated Bibliography” for an explanation about why ASA is used). For books, you’ll want to move the year so that is referenced after the author’s name and add the city and state before the publisher’s name. For articles, you’ll want to move the year and simplify the volume and issue numbers. For sources that you find useful, enter them into a second sheet that includes a citation as well as how you found the article, what the major themes are, any notes you think you need on high-level details about the paper, and cross-references that indicate if the paper is cited by other papers you’ve found. These cross-references are important for making linkages between different aspects of the literature. 3.2.2 Process I strongly encourage students to follow this general process for identifying appropriate literature: Identify appropriate search terms: Based on your research question, what are the keywords that might help you find relevant articles? Identify the “state of the art”: Start by searching Annual Review journals (or similar, such as Sociology Compass) for recent articles that summarize the state of the literature in your area. You may not find an exact match, but you may find reviews of related topics. Use these articles to get a sense of what the “state of the art” is for your topic area(s). Citations from review articles: Use the review articles you find to identify both seminal publications that define a field of study (may not be recent) as well as more recent empirical studies. Find and download these articles. Search other social science publications: Whether or not you find helpful review articles, you will want to also search other key journals. Start with generalist journals and then move to more specific journals focused on particular types of research. Use the same search terms described above. In sociology, for example, the major generalist journals are American Sociological Review, American Journal of Sociology, Social Forces, and Social Problems. In one of my sub-fields, medical sociology, Social Science and Medicine, Journal of Health and Social Behavior, and Health and Place are all key journals. Search related journals: Are there journals from other disciplines that are related? If so, search those as well using your search terms. In my research, the American Journal of Public Health and the Annals of the American Association of Geographers are both important journals from related disciplines. Search Sociological Abstracts: If you are not finding many citations, you may want to search the Sociological Abstracts database, which catalogs many more sociological journals. Iterative Processing of Articles: As you read through the articles you find and download in steps 3 through 7, seek out the studies that they cite that seem related. Download them, read them, and identify more related studies that they cite, then start the process over. Also use this process to identify books.

["evaluating-sources.html", "3.3 Evaluating Sources", " 3.3 Evaluating Sources First, make sure what you’ve found is peer reviewed. If you’ve found a report or a popular press article (something like Time Magazine), hang onto it if you think it provides helpful contextual background but it should not be part of your literature search. If you’ve identified a dissertation or a thesis that seems helpful, there are typically two things worth doing: (1) check to see if it has been published as an article or a book (sometimes you’ll have to check out the author’s CV if you can find it), and (2) use it to identify other peer reviewed materials. Science Magazine has a great article that describes how different academics read articles. If you look through their responses, you’ll notice that few take a new article, read the abstract than read through the article cover to cover. Instead there are a variety of approaches to finding out the “meat” of the article quickly, without reading it in its entirety. Use this as a strategy for figuring out whether or not an article is a good fit for your project. Read the abstract, introduction, and discussion/conclusion sections to get a sense of the paper. Ask yourself if it makes a contribution to what you are researching. If it does, add it to your spreadsheet and fill out the necessary details. If it does not, add it to the “discard” list so you can find it later if you change your mind (or if you forget whether you’ve read it or not!). You can find some more details on the “AIC” technique for reading on Dr. Raul Pacheco-Vega’s website. He also has a reading strategies. If the article does fit into your research, take some basic synthetic notes about the article. These will form the basis of your paragraphs for each source in the annotated bibliography. "],
["writing-an-annotated-bibliography.html", "3.4 Writing an Annotated Bibliography", " 3.4 Writing an Annotated Bibliography The annotated bibliography itself is a document that lists your sources in alphabetical order (or alphabetized within groupings for specific categories). Begin each entry with a full, properly formatted citation using the American Sociological Association (ASA) citation style. I often get questions about whether students can use alternate citation formats. Different journals use different formats, so it is not possible for academics to learn and become comfortable with just one citation style. Rather, we use multiple citation styles regularly. Often, an article manuscript will be written in a specific citation style for one journal only to have to be reformatted in a different style for another journal if it is rejected on the first submission. Learning new citation styles quickly is therefore an important lesson, and one reason why ASA is the only citation style I accept for this project. After the citation style, there should be one to two paragraphs summarizing the article and its importance for your project. The strongest annotated bibliographies will draw substantive or thematic connections between sources, noting which articles are cited by others and which articles share important connections. This will help you develop the synthesis your literature review section for the paper requires. For more, see Dr. Raul Pacheco-Vega’s post on writing an annotated bibliography. "],

["data-cleaning-overview.html", "4.1 Data Cleaning Overview", " 4.1 Data Cleaning Overview 4.1.1 Analysis Development All data cleaning should be done in a single notebook that you clarify and expand over time. Use dplyr, janitor, and sf for data cleaning in short, well-organized pipelines. Your final data sets should be stored as .shp files in the data/ folder along with the original raw data. 4.1.2 General Approach The amount of data cleaning needed will vary significantly based on the data set you are using and the measures you have selected. Thus there are no “one size fits all” instructions for cleaning your data. In general, you will want to focus on making sure a number of criteria are met: Variables should have short, clear, intuitive names. All missing data have been recoded to NA values (if they were not already coded that way). If your data set does not include identification numbers for each row, you will need to create them. The tibble package’s rowid_to_column() function can be used for this. Only columns necessary for mapping should be included - subset out all other columns. Only observations necessary for mapping should be included - subset out all other observations (i.e. if you are using the crime data, subset out all crimes not in the category you are working with). Identify and subset out data missing spatial references. In the crime data set, these will either be missing already (NA values) or have values of 0. In the CSB data set, these will either be missing already (NA values) or have values less than 800000 in the x coordinate and less than 980000 in the y coordinate. If you are using another data source, make sure there are no missing data. The indicators above are similar to the indicators you should look for. Remove observations in the crime data where the count is -1 and in the CSB data where there is a stats of CANCEL. If you are using another data, make sure there are no observations for invalid data, as in calls for service that were cancelled or crimes that were removed from the data set. Clean and modify the values of specific observations as needed. For example if you have a category variable - which both the crime and CSB data do, make sure it returns short, clear values. If you have multiple categories in such a variable, create a new categorical variable that simply differentiates between the relevant codes. For instance, the following values are the focus of a sample project using the CSB data. These nine categories could be summarized as (1) stray animal, loose, (2) stray animal, contained, (3) animal surrender. Stray Animal | 4,102 0.57 83.25 Stray Animal Cntnd | 118 0.02 83.27 Stray Cat | 1,623 0.22 83.49 Stray Dog At Large | 9,036 1.25 84.75 Stray Dog Cntnd-ACC | 1,416 0.20 84.94 Stray Dog Contained | 939 0.13 85.07 Surrender Cat | 18 0.00 85.84 Surrender Dog | 23 0.00 85.84 Surrender Pet | 151 0.02 85.86 Your data cleaning process should follow the data wrangling workflow discussed during lecture-07. For projects using a non-standard data set: You want to follow the same general process as above. You should have point data, though they may come as .csv or .shp data. If they were obtained from a geodatabase, export them to .shp and then import them into R.

["spatial-data-creation.html", "4.2 Spatial Data Creation", " 4.2 Spatial Data Creation Once you have cleaned your data, you will want to project it as an sf object and convert it to the appropriate projected coordinate system. If your data are already in shapefile form, ensure that they are in the appropriate projected coordinate system. You will need two forms of your data: The first should be a shapefile that contains the cleaned point data (i.e. all crimes that you have left after data cleaning, or all CSB calls). The second should be these points aggregated to the census block group. You will need to use the tigris package to download these data, and then perform a spatial join and aggregate the points (this is covered in lecture-11). Make sure you have a measurement of the square miles for each feature to use for normalization. Once you have the shapefiles created, they should be imported into your project’s geodatabase. For projects using a non-standard data set: If you are using data that cover more than one city in the United States, you may want to aggregate the data to a different areal unit. Chat with Chris about the appropriate level of aggregation for your research question. If you are using data that are not for the United States, you will want to aggregate them to a logical areal unit. For some projects, this may be the state or province. For others, it may be the local equivalent of Census geography. Chat with Chris about the appropriate level of aggregation for your research question. Ideally, the level of aggregation you select should be the same level of aggregation that census data are available for (see Vignette 5; i.e. if you have demographic data at the census tract level, aggregate your point data in Vignette 4 to the tract level as well).

["demographic-data-overview.html", "5.1 Demographic Data Overview", " 5.1 Demographic Data Overview You will need to present two demographic variables of your choosing. Think of these broadly (i.e. poverty rates and the percentage of a particular racial group, or median income and population density). The demographic measures you select should be related to your outcomes, so think critically about what possible socio-demographic factors might be related to what you are interested in. You should use the tidycensus package’s load_variables() function (see the tidycensus website and the lecture-09 materials for details) to search for the relevant concepts. Each demographic data point (i.e. population density or median income or poverty rate) should be exported as its own shapefile from R (so you should have a total of two shapefiles for this vignette). These shapefiles should be created in the same coordinate system used Vignette 4. Creating these shapefiles will also necessitate identifying the appropriate geometric data using the tigris package so that the demographic data can be joined with the relevant geometries. Make sure you have a measurement of the square miles for each feature to use for normalization. Once you have the shapefiles created, they should be imported into your project’s geodatabase.

City of St. Louis Boundary - this can be obtained via the tigris package - download the county data for the State of Missouri, and subset out the City of St. Louis (our FIPS code is 510). Illinois Hydrology - The Census TIGER hydrology data is released by county, so bodies of water that lie between jurisdictions end up split. This shapefile contains data on the extent of the Mississippi River in Madison and St. Clair counties for the length of the City of St. Louis. You can obtain the shapefile here. Illinois River Islands - The north side of the City sits opposite a group of islands on the Illinois side of the Mississippi, some of which are included in the Illinois Hydrology layer. The largest of these islands, Mosenthein Island, is described by this shapefile. St. Louis Hydrology - On the Census Bureau’s TIGER website, choose 2018 &gt; Download &gt; Web Interface. Using the drop-down menus, download the “Area Hydrography” data for the City of St. Louis under the “Water” category. Regional Hydrology - Combine the Illinois Hydrology and St. Louis Hydrology data together, and merge the Mississippi River features into a single Mississippi River feature. City of St. Louis Neighborhoods - These can be downloaded from the City of St. Louis’s open data website. Belfontaine/Calvary Cemetery - Using your re-projected neighborhood data, select neighborhood 86, which covers two large cemeteries in North St. Louis - the Belfontaine Cemetery and the Calvary Cemetery. These are park-like areas that should be noted on any maps of the city as a whole. Export only this feature to a feature class in your geodatabase. Missouri Botanical Garden - Using your re-projected neighborhood data, select neighborhood 87, which covers MOBOT. Export only this feature to a feature class in your geodatabase.

State of Missouri Interstate Highway Centerlines - On the Census Bureau’s TIGER website, choose 2018 &gt; Download &gt; Web Interface. Using the drop-down menus, download the national “Primary Roads” data. First, in ArcGIS, geoprocess these so that interstates outside of Missouri are removed. Than, geoprocess them again to combine observations that share the same highway name for the FULLNAME attribute. Than, in R, remove all non-interstate highways (look for a value of I) and create a new variable that has values only for the following highways: 29, 35, 44, 49, 55, 64, and 70.

Illinois Street Bridges - On the Census Bureau’s TIGER website, choose 2018 &gt; Download &gt; Web Interface. Using the drop-down menus, download the “All Roads” data for Madison County, Illinois and St. Clair County, Illinois. In ArcGIS, geoprocess these so that interstates that do not overlap with the Illinois Hydrology data are removed. For Madison County, this should include three bridges (from north to south) for I-270 (New Chain of Rocks Bridge), the Chain of Rocks Pedestrian Bridge, and McKinley Street (McKinley Bridge). For St. Clair County, this should include four bridges (from north to south) for I-70 (Stan Musial Veterans Memorial Bridge), the Martin Luther King Bridge, Washington Avenue (the Eads Bridge), and I-64/I-55 (Poplar Street Bridge). Illinois Interstate Highway Bridges - In R, process the data created in 22 so that you only have observations for three bridges (from north to south): I-270 (New Chain of Rocks Bridge), I-70 (Stan Musial Veterans Memorial Bridge), and I-64/I-55 (Poplar Street Bridge).

Each of the twenty-eight Aldermen represent a single ward within the City, which are in-turn subdivided into precincts. Since Aldermen have individual budgets for their ward, and since so much decision making power rests with the Board as a whole, mapping incidents by ward rather than neighborhood places the spatial distribution in the context of St. Louis’s decision making structure. This map should be a large scale map of a single ward you’ve selected because it has a particularly high incidence of calls for your topic. The size of this map should be determined by the relative amount of space you have, but also by the shape of the ward itself. Try to maximize the size of the map given these constraints. Since you are mapping at a larger scale, use data on city blocks tohighlight street curb lines as well as other detailed data like greenspace locations, railroad line locations, building footprints, and any other data you feel is relevant to your topic.

As you complete the design of your poster, give careful thought to the aesthetics of your layout. Use color strategically and in ways that complement the maps you have already designed. Use boxes around content, such as text boxes, strategically as well. Your overall design should be secondary to your data - color choices, text boxes, and font choices should not distract from the core story that your poster tells. Make sure your font choices are legible and easy to read from a distance. Do not use fonts smaller than 20-24 point, depending on the font face itself, and use variation in font size and weight (bold, italic, etc.) to create a visual hierarchy as you would on a map layout itself. When you export your map images and select accompanying images (such as photographs or, if you wish, a graph), ensure that they are not pixelated when sized to the dimensions available on your wire frame. Use only high quality images on your poster, as low quality or low resolution images are hard to read and detract from your overall design. For maps and images that you did not directly produce (such as the demographic maps and reference maps by your group members, provide appropriate attribution). Be sure to label each map with a title and to place legends near the map they refer to. Refer back to Brewer (2015) to advice on design more generally, and check out the University of Buffalo Library’s guide to poster design.

["poster-printing.html", "10.4 Poster Printing", " 10.4 Poster Printing Your poster can be printed in the Library’s Academic Technology commons area, which is located on the first floor near the West Pine entrance. If you design your poster in Apple Keynote, be sure to arrive with a copy of you poster exported as a .pdf file. During finals, the Library has extended hours that should allow you to get your poster printed in the evening if you are not regularly on campus during the day. They get busy during this period, however, so be sure to give yourself sufficient lead time to get your poster printed. Arriving at the Library just before the poster presentation session is not recommended; we suggest getting your poster printed a day or two before to reduce the likelihood of any delays and give you time to address any issues. Note that you will need to pay using funds from your Billiken Bucks bucks account. The cost of your poster should be approximately thirty dollars. This is significantly cheaper than having a poster printed at a store that offers printing services, like FedEx. "],
